Outline: 
  The purpose of this project is to provide quick and direct medical access to people who may live far away from hospitals or HPs,
  and also for people who need constant updates from a medical professional. MedConnect allows medical professionals
  to send immediate updates to patients via a wrist watch bridging the connection between patient and doctor.
